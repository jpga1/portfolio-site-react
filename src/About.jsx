        Hello, I'm Josh Kho and my goal is to develop quality front-ends. I
        attended Houghton University's computer science program and received a
        bachelors degree in 2023. During my time in university, I discovered
        substantial satisfaction in my work in web development than any other
        focus I have explored in computer science and information technology. I
        continuously look forward to expanding my skills by learning new
        techniques and technologies, and offer valuable services.
